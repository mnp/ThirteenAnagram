Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet 12/7/2011: Need a distraction today? Not
only does 12+1=11+2, but the letters "twelve plus one" rearrange to
give you "eleven plus two"

Sound like a Programming Praxis problem, anyone?

Ugly solution below searches +, -, *, / up to 13, in Emacs Lisp for
practice. Looping constructs, instead of recursion, avoid blowing
out Emacs stack limits.  I estimate O( 2.5 * N^2 ).
